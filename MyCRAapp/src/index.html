    CDN : Content delivery network (ex: url where we can pull content from a file)
crossorigin content attribute on media elements is a CORS settings attribute.
he CORS(crossorigin resource sharing) mechanism supports secure cross-origin requests and data transfers between browsers and servers.
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.
The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing standard works by adding new HTTP headers that let servers describe which origins are permitted to read that information from a web browser
why 2 links or cdn for react and react dom?
React - core dev file
React dome- browser update and dom  ..as react is not fixed only to browser (react native used for mobiles.)
**
**npm : package manager for javascript languagues.
**Inside node modules folder we see many folder other that React and React dom. there are called transitive dependcies. 
   means they are dependencies of depndencies.
**webpack: statid module bundler for modren JS apps.  - combines every module of projects needs into one or more bundles
**babel: Transcompiler used to convert ES2015+ code to lower js code or backward-compatible that can be run by old JS engines.
babel can convert JSX sytanx!
**parcel: is also a bundler. but its a zero configuration bundler . whereas we need a basic config file to run a app with webpack(lates web pack is also a zero config)
   Parcel has tree shaking algorith , code splitting etc (responsibilities of parcel.)
   Hot reloading : or HMR hot module replacement- one of the resp of parcel: when we make change in code and save then the code automatically reloads.
** bundler is a development tool that combines many JavaScript code files into a single one that is production-ready loadable in the browser.
  In simple words a bundler manges all the depencies in large apps t=keeps track of them and update them which saves a lot of time to developers.
   In order to to do -> its creates a dependencies relation ship map. we have to specify a entry point (which is a mian page like index.js or index.html)
   and bundler automatically find what are its dependencies and dependency of dependencies etc.
   Once the mapping is done its delivers a static assests that browser can successfully process.
 **Live Server : help us to run the code locally with command (ctl+shipy+p and serach for open with live server)
                bundler (ex: Parcel) hepl us to run the code instead of web server   or parcels one of the responsibility is to initiate live serve.

** diff b/w dependencies and dev dependencies?
  npm i --package neame - is a dependencies
  npm i -D will install dev dependencies. (we need it in local code but not production so we get them as dev dependencies)
** diff b/w npm and npx ?
npx -generally executes the code rite away.

.parcel-cache ?

package.json and package-lock.json - will have all the inf req for recreating node modules. In package wemay have ^ symbol which may install latest version. but the package-lock ensures that we use the version provided in package-lock in prod app
pacg-lock - will have exact snapshot of dependenies info currently running in dev.
